# Planetary Motion v Techplosion

Planetary Motion, Inc. v. Techplosion, Inc., 261 F.3d 1188 (11th Cir. 2001)

Darrah developed a email client called "Coolmail".
Coolmail was distributed under the GNU GPL
SuSe distributed Coolmail

Darrah never sold Coolmail
Darrah distributed it widely to a unkown number of "technically skilled UNIX-users"

Distribution of software over the internet is worthy of trademark protection
The fact that GPL licensed software is commonely distributed without charge is no barrier to trademark rights.

"That the Software had been distributed pursuant to a GNU General Public License does not defeat trademark ownership, nor does this in any way compel a finding that Darrah abandoned his rights in trademark. Appellants misconstrue the function of a GNU General Public License. Software distributed pursuant to such a license is not necessarily ceded to the public domain and the licensor purports to retain ownership rights, which may or may not include rights to a mark."

# Wallace v IBM Corp.

Wallace v. IBM Corp., 467 F.3d 1104 (7th Cir. 2006)



# Jacobsen v Katzer

Jacobsen v. Katzer, 535 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008)

Jacobsen managed the open source project, Java Model Railroad Interface
  * JMRI programmed decoder chips that control model trains
  * Licensed under the Artistic License
  * Copyright notices and refered people to look to the license in the COPYING file.

Katzer offered a competing product, Decoder Commander, that also programms decoder chips for model trains
  * Katzer used a portion of files from the JMRI project in Decoder Commander
  * Katzer did not follow the terms of the Artistic license. Failed to include:
    * JMRI Author's name
    * JMRI copyright notices
    * JMRI references to the COPYING file
    * identification of JMRI as the source of the copied files
    * description of how the files where change

Jacobsen sued and moved for a preliminary injection based on the theory that violating the terms of the Artistic License was copyright infringement.

Trial court denied the motion because case did not sound in copyright, but rather in contract. Court concluded that the only remedies available for violating the Artistic license was for contract claims based on the breech of the agreement.


What we learned from this case:
* One who exceeds the scope of a license to reproduce a copyrighted work likewise is an infringer of the copyright.
* Artistic license is enforceable based on a theory of copyright infringement
* Preliminary injunctions are often available as a remedy for violating free software licenses

# Copyright Management Information/ DMCA

District court also ruled that
Jacobsen had adequently plead a claim for unauthorized removal or alteration copyright management information under the DMCA 17 U.S.C 1202(b).

Copyright management information includes
* title or other information indentifying the work
* name/identifying information about the author
* name/infomration about the copyright holder
* terms and conditions for use of the work
