#The "Popular Licenses"

OSI-approved licenses that are popular, widely used, or have strong communities

## "Popular Licenses"

- Apache License 2.0
- BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license
- BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" license
- GNU General Public License (GPL)
- GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)
- MIT license
- Mozilla Public License 2.0
- Common Development and Distribution License
- Eclipse Public License

# Categories of Licenses

OSI Classified the licenses into several categories

## Categories

- Licenses that are "popular and widely-used or with strong communities" 
- International licenses
- Special purpose licenses
- Other/Miscellaneous licenses
- Licenses that are redundant with more popular licenses

# Categories of Licenses

OSI Classified the licenses into several categories

## Categories

- Non-reusable licenses
- Superseded licenses
- Licenses that have been voluntarily retired
- Uncategorized Licenses

# Contract Language

- "Some AWS Content and Third-Party Content may be provided to you under a separate license, such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, or other *open source license.* In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any separate license, the *separate license will prevail* with respect to the AWS Content or Third-Party Content that is the subject of such separate license." [AWS Customer Agreement, Nov. 1, 2018](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/)


# Contract Language

You may only use software that is available in source code form under license  approved by the Open Source Initiative and listed at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ (“Open Source Software”)

# What do these “separate licenses” say?

* What are you agreeing to when you agree to all of those licenses?
* Does anyone go and read all of the licenses?
* How do I know if it is okay to agree to that?
* Is there better language to be express what my clients are willing to agree to?

# What do these “separate licenses” say?

* I am going to focus on the licenses that are not the “popular” ones
* I am only going to be talking about licenses approved by OSI as meeting the Open Source Definition
* I am including all of the approved licenses even the retired ones
* Goal is to give a sense of the range of terms that could appear in a generic OSI approved open source license
* I am asking, but not answering, the question: is there a better way to define what licenses are acceptable? 

# What Kind of the Material do the licenses apply to

* AGPL applies to “any copyrightable work”
* Apache 2.0 applies to “work of authorship”

# What Kind of the Material

But some licenses only apply to a subset of copyrightable works

* Only applies to Software

    * Zero-Clause BSD
    * ISC License

* ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE only applies to “computer program”
* CECIIL-2.1 only applies to “Software and documentation”

# What Kind of the Material
Any of course there are some licenses that apply to really specific material

Frameworx license only applies to the “Frameworx Code Base”

# What Kind of the Material

Generally:

* applies to any “copyrightable work” (or equivalent phrase) 
* software and accompanying documentation
* just software

# What Kind of the Material

Don’t assume all licenses operate the same. 

If some hands you a project that is licensed under the ISC License. Should I be asking if I have a license to use the documentation? What about any data files that might be required? How useful is a video game if you only get a license to the “software” and not any of the data on the levels, maps, or characters?

# Rights Granted

Similarly for rights granted.

Apache grants:

* “copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works” and;
* “patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work”

# Rights Granted

Can we make this broad assumption for all FOSS licenses.

Fair License says: “*Usage* of the works is permitted provided that...”

# Rights Granted

Can we make this broad assumption for all FOSS licenses.

In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license *requires that the original test modes be preserved.*

 -Open Group Test Suite License

# Rights Granted

You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package . . . . provided that you do at least the following:

. . . . 

rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and *provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable* and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

 -Open Group Test Suite License

# Rights Granted

And sometimes you don’t have the right to distribute modified versions of the software

2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form….
3. You may make modifications to the Software and distribute your modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as patches.

The Q Public License Version (QPL-1.0)

# What I am talking about

* This is not a list of every OSI approved licensed
* I am not going to read all of the licenses to you
* But I did want to share some surprises that go against most peoples general exceptions for how OSI approved open source licenses operate

# Restrictions on use

Restricting the price of services related to the software

“3 (b) Any Value-Added Services that you offer . . . in relation to any Downstream Distribution shall be offered and provided on commercial terms that are reasonably commensurate to the fair market value of such Value-Added Services. In addition, the terms and conditions on which any such Value Added Services are so offered or provided shall be consistent with, and shall fully support, the intent and purpose of this License Agreement.

“This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software“ - CDDL v1.0

* Adaptive Public License defaults to New York unless otherwise specified


#Venue

Similar properties to the choice of law clauses

* Specific Jurisdiction
* Dependent on who the licensor is (State or national governments)
* Some twists

#Venue

… .

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive relief related to a breach of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction.

# Statute of Limits

At least 5 OSI approved licenses limit both or one of the parties from bringing a cause of action more than one year after the cause of action arises (APL, EPL, CATOSL-1.1, IPL, LPL) 

“No party may bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the action arose.”

Adaptive Public Licensed

# Warranties

All of them have a “as is” warranty (almost)

But …

“This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. *No license to the Original Work is granted* by this License except under this disclaimer.” 

Open Software License 3.0

# limitations of Liability

Similarly almost all licenses try to disclaim all libaility

But …

* What about attempts to attempts to limit the license beyond what is allowed by the local jurisdiction
* Some have specified damage caps (Watcom $500; RPSL $10; RSCPL $5,000)

# Third Party Beneficiaries

10.1. The obligations imposed by this License are for the *benefit* of the Initial Contributor and any Recipient, and each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Contributor and/or *any other Recipient may enforce the terms* and conditions of this License *against any Recipient.*

# Attribution Requirements

Several Licenses have requirements for displaying Attribution Information

_each time the resulting executable program or a program dependent thereon is launched, a prominent display (e.g., splash screen or banner text) of the Author's
attribution information, which includes:_

Attribution Assurance License

AAL also requires the license text to be signed by GPG.

# Attribution Requirements

“As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur (the "ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION").”

# Notices

Normal requirement to keep notices in place, or even to add them to specific files.

# Legal Notifications

Sometimes you need to describe the limitations on your license being offered (MPL 1.0 derived licenses)

If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License …  then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the [the reason or law] and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file  … . Except to the extent prohibited . . . such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of *ordinary skill at computer programming* to be able to understand it.

- MOTOSOTO OPEN SOURCE LICENSE - Version 0.9.1

# Legal Notifications

If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality . . . you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" . . . . If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available . . . You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take _other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained._

# Super user Rights
EU Datagrid gives a license to EUDatagrid anytime you publish or distribute modifications not accompanied with a written agreement.

# Super User Rights

*If you are the Current Maintainer* of the Work, you may, *without restriction*, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also *distribute* the Derived Work *without restriction,* including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. . . .

*If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work*, you may distribute a Derived Work *provided* the following conditions are met . . .

LaTeX Project Public License, Version 1.3c

# Creating Derivative Licenses
* Open Software License prevents you from calling your derivative  license “open source” unless it is approved by OSI
* Some licenses don't name the license steward and the license steward is in effect the originally copyright holder, who can publish new versions of the license for the program


# Conclusions

* Big variety of terms
* Contains variations on a lot the things transactional lawyers nitpick about
* There is a chance your licensing experiment has been run if read all of the licenses
* Consider moving from accepting all "open source licenses" to a defined subset
* Its hard to make generalizations about open source software
